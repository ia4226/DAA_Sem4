#BinarySearch
It is the searching technique that works efficiently on sorted lists to follow Divide and Conquer.

#Pseudocode
binary_search
sorted array -> A
size of array -> n
value to be searched -> X

set lower bound = 1
set lower bound = n

while x not found
 if upperbound < lowerbound
  EXIT: X does not exist
 set midpoint = (lowerbound + upperbound)/ 2

if A[midpoint] < X
  set lowerbound = midpoint + 1
if A[midpoint] > X
  set upperbound = midpoint - 1
A[midpoint] = X
  EXIT: X found at location midpoint
  end while
end procedure.

#TimeComplexity
Best - O(1)
Average - O(log n )
Worst - O(log n)
