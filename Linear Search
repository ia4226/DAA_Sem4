Linear Search: 
It is a sequential searching algorithm, where to start from one end and check every element of the list, till the desired element is not found. 
It is the simplest searching algorithm.


array[i] --> elemts of the array in i
k --> element/data to be searched

//Pseudocode

for(i=0;i<n;i++){
if(array[i] == k)
printf("Element is found %d", i);}
break;
}

Time Complexity:
(a) Best Case - O(1) [element is at the first position]
(b) Average Case - O(n)
(c) Worst Case -O(n) [element not found]
